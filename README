v2.1
1) Uses C code for computeBF() loop. This has led to a speed up of aobut 25 times.
2) This can be built directly on MAC, maybe even Fisher cluster!
   (How?)
   I had to modify the Makeconf file in /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/etc/i386/, and
   copy it over to the src/ directory of the package as Makevars.in and add an autoconf file in the top level 
   of the package.

Apr 11th 2009
v3.0
1) Use Rprintf instead of printf. (DONE)
2) Add debugging statements to variable selector. (DONE)
3) Check it on the Fisher cluster. (NOT DONE)
